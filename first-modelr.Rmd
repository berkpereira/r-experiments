# Separate into non elderly (<65) and elderly population
ag <- stratify_by_age(demography, limits=c(65)) # c( 43670500, 8262600 )

# Separate in risk groups. In this case we assume one additional (high) risk groups and that respectively 
# 1 percent of non elderly and 40% of elderly are in this risk group. It is possible to
# define an additional risk group (e.g. pregnant women) if desired
